# This is about S-HERO result


1. This is a source code based on Turtlebot core.ino by ROBOTIS.
2. It is originally aimed at controlling omni-wheel car(ROS, arduino). 
3. Now it is just cover velocity, but soon I'll add position control code.
4. Users can easily use this code. It supports 'teleop control' using keyboard(omni-wheel)
